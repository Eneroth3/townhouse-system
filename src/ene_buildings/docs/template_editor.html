    <h1>Editing Templates</h1>
    <p>
      Templates are the base to draw a building from.
      Installed templates are stored as .bldg files in the building template directory of the plugin directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To share a template with someone, just give them the .bldg file for that template.
      The template directory can be opened from <i>Extensions > Eneroth Townhouse System > Template Editing > Open Template Directory</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While being edited a template is represented by a component.
      There are 3 ways to get such a component.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>An existing template saved to the library can be opened from the template editing menu or toolbar <img src="../toolbar_icons/template_open.png" />.</li>
      <li>The component can also be placed from Sketchup's native component browser if it has already been loaded for the model.</li>
      <li>A new component can be created from the selected entities by clicking New in the template editing menu or toolbar <img src="../toolbar_icons/template_new.png" />.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To save the template to the library (and pack it as a .bldg file) click Save Template in the toolbar <img src="../toolbar_icons/template_save.png" />.
    </p>

    <h2>1 Main Volume</h2>
    <img src="template_volume.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      The main volume of the building must be drawn directly in the component to be recognized by the plugin.
      The two gable faces must point in <span class="axis-negative x">negative</span> and <span class="axis x">positive X</span>.
      All other faces must be perpendicular to these two.
      The volume can have any length but the length its drawn to will be used when creating the preview image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side of the volume towards <span class="axis-negative y">negative Y</span> is considered the front side.<!--TODO: how to do with "gavelarkitektur"?-->
      The facade plane should intersect default ground level along the <span class="axis x">X axis</span><!--TODO: Ignorera grund, takutsprång etc. används det huvudsakliga fasadplanet.-->
    </p>

    <h2 id="dlg_template_info">2 Template Info <img src="../toolbar_icons/template_info.png" /></h2>
    <p>
      The template info dialog is used to set the template attributes, such as ID and name.
    </p>
    <h3>2.1 General</h3>
    <p>
      Name - What the template should be called.
      So far I haven't come up with a naming convention so write anything you find relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modeler - The person saving the template. If the template is based on another person's template use your own name anyway but credit them in the description.
    </p>
    <p>
      ID - Starts with a prefix based on your name to avoid name collisions and people accidentally overwriting each other files when sharing them.
      If you for instance use the prefix "ene" (reserved by me, Eneroth3) and then update the plugin the template might be overwritten by one I made that is included in the plugin and happens to have the same name.
      The preview image shows either a template saved by the currently written ID or a placeholder so if you accidentally chose an ID that already exists for your installed templates the preview for it is shown.
    </p>
    <h3>2.2 Alignment</h3>
    <p>
      Alignment tells if the sides of the building are typically aligned towards a street, a courtyard or another building (firewall).
    </p>
    <p>
      Depth is measured between the facade planes and details such as bay windows and eaves can be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dlg_part_info">3 Part Info<img src="../toolbar_icons/template_part_info.png" /></h2>
    <p>
      The part info dialog is used to set attributes to the currently selected group or component,
      such as its positioning within the building.
    </p>
    <h3>3.1 Positioning</h3>
    <p>
      These settings changes the <span class="axis x">X coordinate</span> where the group/component is placed (where its origin is).
      <span class="axis y">Y</span> and <span class="axis z">Z</span> coordinates will be kept as they are in model.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option must be set for the part to be drawn at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Group/component axes can be displayed by going to Windows > Model Info > Components and tick the checkbox "Show component axes" to easier locate the origins.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.1 Array</h4>
    <div class="img-and-text"><img src="template_spread.png" alt="" />Margin and interval on resulting building.</div>
    <!--<div class="img-and-text"><img src="template_spread_alternate.png" alt="" />Alternating components.</div>-->
    <p>
      Array is used to evenly spread a number of groups/components along the width of the building volume,
      either by a fixed number or by an approximate distance between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margins can be used to add a fixed distance at each side before spreading evenly over the remaining space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of groups/components can be forced to either an even or odd value by setting rounding.
    </p>
    <div class="img-and-text"><img src="template_spread_override_cut_planes.png" alt="" />Dormer window not drawn when outside building.</div><!--
    --><div class="img-and-text"><img src="template_spread_override_cut_planes2.png" alt="" />Dormer window drawn anyway.</div>
    <p>
      By default groups/components are not drawn if they are positioned partly besides the main building volume. This behavior can be overridden if undesired.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.2 Align and centering</h4>
    <p>
      Places origin at the edge or in the middle of the volume.
      Left is towards <span class="axis-negative x">negative X</span> and right towards <span class="axis x">positive X</span>.
    </p>
    <h4>3.1.3 Relative</h4>
    <p>
      Relation between distance from <span class="axis-negative x">negative X</span> (left) side and building width.
      E.g 0,25 is a quarter of the building width, starting from the left side.
    </p>
    <h3>3.2 Material Replacement</h3>
    <p>
      By default all materials on the main volume can be replaced from the building Properties dialog.
      By ticking "Replace materials within this part" the plugin will also check for and replace materials within this group.
      This is useful when a group has multiple materials to replace so painting the group/component itself doesn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option is only available for groups.<!--TODO: if not in root all parents must be groups with this set to true as well. check for that in ruby.-->
      Automatically modifying individual components would clutter the component browser with multiple versions of it.
      However the plugin allows you to easily convert a component to a group.
    </p>
    <!--
    Component replacements:
      It's generally good practice to position the replacement outside the main volume to clearly show it's not an arrayed/spread component/group"
      Cannot be combined with solid operations.
     Gables
      Cannot be combined with solid operations.
     Internal Corner (Formerly "hörntorn")
      Cannot be combined with solid operations.
    -->
    <h3>3.3 Solid Operations</h3>
    <p>
      Solid union and subtract can be performed with a group/component onto the main volume of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solid operations are slow to perform. If possible use cut-opening components instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solid index is used to determine what order to perform the operations in starting at the lowest number. Default is 0.
    </p>
    <h4>3.3.1 Cut Multiple Faces</h4>
    <p>
      There's also an option to use the part's naked edges to cut openings, similar to the native cut opening feauture but on multiple faces at once.
      This is strictly isn't a solid operation and is always performed after the the real solid operations (union and subtract).
      This feature is useful when the part spans multiple faces, e.g. a bay window the roof eaves and continuing on the roof.
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      This feaure can be used both cut into the facade and add materialo onto it at once.
    </p>-->
