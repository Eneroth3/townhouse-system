A .building file is a zip archive containing the relevant informations to draw a
a building with Eneroth Townhouse System.

The basename of the .building file is the same the ID used internally for the
template. This name should start by an author unique prefix followed by an
underscore (similar to how plugins themselves are wrapped in an author specific
namespace).

# TODO: COMPONNET REPLACEMENT: document these.

The prefix is to avoid name collisions and people's templates being overwritten
by other people's template. When modifying a template by another person use your
own prefix.

info.json
  Contains template information that can be loaded into Sketchup without loading
  the model, saved as a JSON string. All these keys are optional.

  depth       (Float)  Length between front and back side measured in inches.
  description (String)
  modeler     (String) The name/nickname of the person saving the template.
                       This is primarily to avoid name collisions and people's
                       templates being overwritten by other people's templates.
                       When modifying a template by another person use your own
                       name and *ID PREFIX* and credit the original creator in
                       the description.
  source      (String) From where data template is based on comes from, e.g.
                       title of a book or website.
  source_url  (String) Online resource to find source.
  stories     (Int)
  year        (Int)    Year built.

model.skp
  Contains the geometry and materials used to draw the template.

  Main building volume consists of raw geometry in the model root.
  The building should extend towards positive Y.
  The model X axis should be where the facade plane meets ground level.
  The side walls must be co-planar to Y-Z plane.
  There must only be two side wall faces, one per side.
  Faces must be correctly oriented (front side outwards).
  Volume must be solid.

  Component and groups can be dynamically adapted according to building
  properties by saving attributes to them.

  align:
    Where to place the group/component origin relative to building segment width
    on the line parallel to x axis passing through its origin.
    Cannot be used along with spread. If both are set align is used.
    Values: "left" | "right" | "center" | <any Float>.
    Float 0 corresponds to left side and 1 to right side.
  margin:
    What distance should be left on each side when arraying group/component.
    Does not affect align. To have a margin on an aligned group/component
    reposition its internal origin.
    Values: <any Length>.
    When not set margin is 0.
  margin_left:
    As margin but for left side only.
    When not set margin is used instead.
  margin_right:
    As margin but for right side only.
    When not set margin is used instead.
  override_cut_planes:
    By default arrayed groups/components are not drawn if they are positioned
    partly outside the building segment.
    Set to true to override and draw them anyway.
  rounding:
    Force rounding of number of arrayed group/components to either even or odd
    number.
    Values: "force_odd" | "orce_even".
    Default is rounding to nearest integer.
  replace_nested_materials:
    Allows material replacement inside this group. This can be used on complex
    groups such as bay window to allow user to replace multiple materials within
    it instead of just the material attached to the group as a whole.
    Since this alters the groups content it's not available for components.
    Values: true
    By default this is false.
  solid:
    Solid operation this group/component performs on main building section
    volume.
    Values: "union" | "subtract".
  solid_index:
    Order to perform solid operations in. Lowest first.
    Values: <any Integer>.
  spread:
    Array group/component along line parallel to X axis.
    Cannot be used along with align. If both are set align is used.
    Values: <any Integer> | <any Length>.
    When integer, group/component is arrayed this number of times.
    Integer must not be negative.
    When length, group/component is arrayed with approximately length as
    distance between. The number of group/components can be forced to be rounded
    to an odd or even integer (see rounding).
    Length must be positive.
