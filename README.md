# Eneroth Townhouse System

Quickly draw townhouses for perimeter blocks. Supports non-orthogonal corners and gables.

Please note that this is a somewhat early project of mine, and very likely one of the first I ever used Git for. Not all content of this project should be regarded as exemplary. Less than ideal practices can be found in, but not limited to, Git commit messages, multiple versions of same file checked in, peripheral project files checked in, end results (RBZ files) checked in, references to Fixnum, lack of an inference reference input point for subsequent corner placements, custom data storage in plugin folder, outdated visual appearance, unjustified use of pixel graphics, and use of swear words.
